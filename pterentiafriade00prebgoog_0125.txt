Introduction, litua.

The following are the prominent features of the work : -

r. lt presents the subject in a systematic form. The general
principles and laws of the science are first clearly stated and illus·
trated3 then the words are treated in their etymological order.

2. lt gives a new and simple plan, presenting side by side for
each group of related words the form of the root in Indo-European‚
Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, with the meaning of the root.

3. lt gives great prominence to the derivation of English words
supplying to a large degree the place of an English etymology.

4. Being furnished with a complete index for every root and word
treated, it can be conveniently used as a work of reference.

5. lt presents the entire subject in a form thoroughly adapted to
school use in classes·

6. The present work is the first school-book to set forth in the
English language the principles and the application of the new sys-
tem of l.-E. Phonetics. This work may be used without confusion
in connection with any grammar or lexicon.
