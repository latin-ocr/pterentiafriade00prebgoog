Α Brief History of Roman literature.

For Schools and Colleges. Translated and edited from the German
edition of Bender by Professors E. P. CROWELL and H. B. RICHARD·
son of Amherst College. Square16m0. 152pages. Mailing price,
51.10; Introduction, βιοῦ.

This work was received with great favor in Germany‚ and was
widely adopted by the secundary schools.

The present translation adapts it to the use of schoois and
colleges in America, not only by retaining all that is valuable in the
German work, but by adding copious references to the best general
and special English works on Roman Literature.

The table of contents has been greatly enlarged, so as to consti-
tute a complete analysis of the whole, and the chart at the end has
been put into better form, in short, the aim hasbeen to make ita
serviceable handbook for students and teachers.

The chief excellence of the work consists in its terse, suggestive,

and admirable characterizations of the Roman writers and of their
times. lt contains just what the student ought to know, and sug-

gests much sor the teacher to enlarge upon.
