This essay on the nature of the gods is at once our most accessible
and most complete original authority on the theology of the ancients;
it gives us a complete exposition of the doctrines of those schools
of philosophy which, in later times, included the greater number os
educated people.

The treatise consists of four parts: first, a brief siretch of the
most noteworthy opinions on the subject, from the beginning of,
philosophie speculation down to the complete development of the
Epicurean and the Stoic systems3 second, a detailed exposition of
the Epicuream and third, of the Stoic philosophy3 fourth,a criti·
cism of both these systems from the standpoint of the academie
scepticism.

Cicero was the first to develop the ,Latin language so as to make
it fit ior the treatment of philosophical subjects. We owe to him
an acquaintance with many portions of the ancient philosophy of
which we should otherwise be quite ignorant3 and however dispar·
aging the judgment of, many people nowadays, no one can deny the
importance of these works for the history of philosophy. “ ·
